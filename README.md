# Mental Health Chatbot

Worked with a team of 4 members in the development of a mental health chatbot which enabled end-users to interact, receive information and recommendations on best approaches to various mental health issues. My role was developing the algorithm and the front-facing web application utilized in building the chatbot. My team-mates were involved in data collection and entry, report generation and system design.

Python was the main language used in creating the chatbot and flask was the web framework used for the development of the UI.

To run the chatbot:
- Download files and run 'app.py'.
- After running, Enter 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/' on your web broswer to access the chatbot.
